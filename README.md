  Entry-level & Internship Roles • Open to Remote Opportunities
</p>




Career-transitioning Data Analyst focused on transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights using SQL, Power BI, and Excel.

I build end-to-end analytics projects — from querying data in MySQL, cleaning and analyzing it in Excel, to designing interactive Power BI dashboards that support data-driven decision-making.

My GitHub highlights hands-on, practical projects across SQL, Excel, and Power BI, demonstrating real analytical workflows rather than theory. Each project reflects how data is used in real business scenarios.

I’m preparing to apply for entry-level and internship data roles, with a strong preference for remote opportunities and exposure to diverse industries to build adaptable analytics skills.
